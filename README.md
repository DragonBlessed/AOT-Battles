# AOT-Battles

A game that I am working on using Pygame from Python. 
Ik video tutorials aren't ideal, but i just watched a tutorial to learn Pygame anyway because i cant be fucked reading pygame documentation atm.
will modify code to make it more original.


Ideas:

- **Character Selection**: Allow players to choose a range of characters
- **Titans**:
- Eren Yeager's Attack Titan
- Reiner Braun's Armored Titan
- Bertholdt Hoover's/Armin Arlert's(?) Colossal Titan
- Annie Leonhart's Female Titan
- Ymir's/Porco's Jaw Titan(?)
- Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan

- **Humans**:
- Levi Ackerman
- Mikasa Ackerman
- Sasha Braus
- Connie Springer
- Jean Kirstein
- Armin Arlert

- Possibly:
- Erwin Smith

- **Rock Projectiles/Thunder Spears**
- **Enemy Waves**
